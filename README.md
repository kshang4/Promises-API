This project was written in TypeScript
Created API to fetch certain information from multiple different databases and uses them together to display accurate and updated weather and locale data.
First run "npm install"

To see program run, run command:
npm run test
*this no longer passes the test cases as the databases are not always online

This project also has an API to give a top recipe in a database given the user's input of protein and region.
To run this API, run command:
npm run start
